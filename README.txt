# This program is meant to be an encryption type based software
# The encryption key is determined by the ASCII code of the user's login input
# without the 1 nor the 0, and cannot excede 4 characters.
# If a key is the same than one other, a function is called to find a not used one
# This is made to garantee that the key is unique and each user can only decrypt his own files
